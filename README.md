# A code that check a version in python using ``requests``

- The version must ``match`` with the pastebin text.
- The pastebin link must be a ``raw link``
- If the version in the code is different than the one from the pastebin, the code will automatically redirect the user to the link you introduced
```webbrowser.open_new_tab("")```

## Enjoy using the code :)
